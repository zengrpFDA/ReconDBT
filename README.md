# ReconDBT
Recosntruction package for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)

Summary

This package,named ReconDBT, contains open-source reconstruction functions for digital breast tomosynthese (DBT) written in Mathworks’ MATLAB language. Filtered back projection (FBP) and two iterative reconstruction (IR) functions, the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction
technique (SART) and maximum likelihood (ML), are included in this package. They can be used to reconstruct 3D DBT volume for for
the common circular-arc trajectory DBT and non-circular arc trajectory DBT. ReconDBT is built on top of the publically
available CT reconstruction code developed by Dr. Fessler [2]. The package runs on Linux and Mac operating systems. Note that it does not run on Windows operating systems because Fessler’s CT reconstruction package does not support Windows system.
